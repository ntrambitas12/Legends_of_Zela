# CSE3902Project
This is the repository for Team Magenta's CSE 3902 Project.
We are working on recreating a replica of Zelda from scratch.

TASK TRACKING: https://dev.azure.com/CSE3902Magenta/CSE%203902/_workitems

KNOWN ISSUES:
1. Enemy behavior is not accurate for aquamentus, wallmaster, and trap. we are working to address this next sprint.
2. Due to how our room array is set up, we can not accurately transfer Link to the right room when he walks through a door. 
This indexing issue will be addressed in Sprint 4.
3. The bomb does not blow up bombable walls. We will implement this in Sprint 4.
4. Correct damage/death animations will be worked on next sprint.
5. currently, all rooms are drawn in their open state for the purpose of the demo.
This is purely for exploration purposes, and closed door functionality is implemented.

To run, fork/download a zip and import it to visual studio, run solution.
