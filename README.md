# CSE3902Project
This is the repository for Team Magenta's CSE 3902 Project.
We are working on recreating a replica of Zelda from scratch.

Currently, there are no bugs in our code (or we have yet to discover any). 
All the intended functionality from sprint 2 is included as of the time of 
this writing. In future sprints, we want to reorganize our Game1.cs and add
a level loader. With that, our reset functionality will change. We will also
clean up some of the controllers since they were used just to demonstrate that
we can switch between tiles and items. Overall, we are very happy with our code
and we think we did a pretty decent job considering this is our first time coding in
C# and designing a game.

To run, fork/download a zip and import it to visual studio, run solution.
