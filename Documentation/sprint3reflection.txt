Sprint 3 reflection. 
This sprint went even better than the last one. Organization and communication were
two things we prioritezed this sprint and did a good job of managing. Upon code reviews we realized we have
some refactoring we need to do, mostly for readablility. Nothing game breaking. we had much better git management
and fewer issues as a team. In conclusion the changes we made from sprint 2 were benefitial and allowed us to preform
more effienctly. We still have improvments to make as a team but we are on the right track.
