The readability of this file is very good. All variable names are clear and
meaningful, so while there may not be many comments, they aren't necessary
because the code is easily understood. The spacing is consistent throughout the
file and very well organized. It's easy to tell what is going on and how to
easily change the file.

These files don't have any comments, but that is okay. The readibility is very
good still. The names of the variables are descripitive enough that it is easy
to tell what is going on, but the names aren't so long that it takes away from
the readibilty. Additionally, there is a clear task being accomplished which
helps make this code easy to read.
