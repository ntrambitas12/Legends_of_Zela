Code review took 15 minutes

This code is very concise and readable. Good use of constant variables to avoid
magic numbers, and these variables have descriptive names where it is easy to
tell what they represent. This is much more readable than just using the
numbers. However, casting these enum values to ints reduces readability slightly.
It may have been possible to use constant int variables instead, although I’m
unsure the scope of this enum so it might be necessary to have it as is. Either
way, this is a readability concern to keep in mind for the future. Otherwise,
nice job avoiding clutter and giving descriptive names to otherwise seemingly
random numbers.
