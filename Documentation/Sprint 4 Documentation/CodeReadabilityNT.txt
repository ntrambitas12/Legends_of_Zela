Overall, the dropType files are easily readable. They are well commented,
spaced nicely, and use easy to understand variable names. My only complaint
is that there are a lot of dropType files and it is hard to look for a specific
functionality when searching thru the folder containing all of these files. 
I feel that some of this could have been data driven more and we would end up
having fewer files. Good work tho!
