Code review took 5 minutes

This is some of the most readable code in our entire project. Methods are restricted to at most, 6 lines.
Variable updates are practical and clear. The get set design pattern is used here with great effect to
keep methods tight. There are only 5 fields in the class, four of which are set in the constructor directly without
depending on other classes.
