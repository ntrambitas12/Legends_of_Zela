Overall, this file has very good code quality. It follows the entity-component 
paradigm which makes it super easy and modular to be able to create new AI enemy
behavior for different enemies. This is a massive improvement from hardcoding the
AI for enemies like it was done previosly in roomObjectManager. The module was
very well thought out and it makes it easy to have flexible and reusable AI code.
I cannot think of any improvements. Good job!
