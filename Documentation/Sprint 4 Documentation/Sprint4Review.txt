Sprint 4 reflection. 
The team came together as everyone found their role and preformed at a high level. No one was dead weight. We paced out the sprint
appropriatly so we didn't have to cram too much at the end. Communication both online and in person helped 
iron out bugs and stuck points we had doing our individual tasks. The efforts we made to fix the issues that held us back 
in earlier sprints are paying off and we are excited to see how we do on the final sprint.

Known Issues:
1. Aquamentus is only able to shoot one fireball. Either FireProjectile command or FireballType need to be changed to address this.
2. We chose to implement Link's health in terms of full heath rather than half hearts. His health value is still true to the game, however.
3. Link does not have frames for holding up the Bow and Triforce. This needs to be changed in SpriteFactory.
4. As a result of prioritizing a fully functional game, SpriteFactory refactoring got put on the back burner.
5. Locked doors are shown as closed doors, but retain their intended functionality.
6. Enemies only have one health, need to figure out what is going wrong in ConcreteSprite.
7. Randomly, when enemies die, some invisible entity is left behind that damages the player.

Known fixes from Sprint 3:
1. Enemy behavior has been addressed.
2. Link now correctly moves to the proper room when walking through door
3. Keese behaviour and collisions have also been fixed
4. Death animations added for enemies
5. Link can now shoot his sword at full health
6. Rooms are drawn with their correct door states
