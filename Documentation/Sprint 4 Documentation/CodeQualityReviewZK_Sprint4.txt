I would say that the quality of this code is quite good, with few code smells.
Instance variables are set. Each method is short and concise, with one distinct
purpose that it accomplishes well. Using a Dictionary was a good solution to the
sheer amount of different sounds that must be loaded and played. Good use of the
factory design pattern to load this dictionary. Methods are public and instances
are private. Identifiers are clear and not vague at all. Well done!

One change we could make to the game would be to add different sound effects for
new actions or change the background music or sounds for existing actions. This
current implementation could very easily support this change, as all that would
be needed is loading different sound files in the sound factory that’s used to
populate our SoundManager dictionary.
