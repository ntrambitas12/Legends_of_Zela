Overall this file has very good code quality. A dictionary is used for the
different locations of the HUD which is very good. Throughout this code there is
little compexity, loose coupling, and high cohesion. These are all preferred.
There are very clever solutions throughout this to keep the class as small as
possible. Helper methods are used to keep the important methods very
understandable. The only change I would reccomend is to remove the literals
throughout to further data drive this code.
