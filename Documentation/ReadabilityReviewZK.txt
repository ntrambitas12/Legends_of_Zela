Code review took 15 minutes

Code is easily readable. All variables are declared at the top of the class and
initialized right below in the first method. Variables have clear names and
meanings which can easily be deciphered. Each method is cohesive and concise
with very specific intentions/behavior, so this file has high cohesion. You can
set and return each variable for the items, and it is clear which methods
accomplish which task. Well done!
