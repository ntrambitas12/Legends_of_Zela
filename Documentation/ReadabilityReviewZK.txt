Code is easily readable. All variables are declared at the top of the class and
initialized right below in the first method. Variables have clear names and
meanings which can easily be deciphered. Each method is cohesive and concise
with very specific intentions/behavior, so this file has high cohesion. You can
set and return each variable for the items, and it is clear which methods
accomplish which task. Well done!

This pull request is a huge positive in terms of readability. The changes to
these files clean up Game1 and LevelLoader tremendously, making each of them
much easier to read and understand what they do. By pulling out the initialization
of the mouse and keyboard controllers with registering their commands into a
separate class, Game1 got much smaller and more concise, which helps with its
previous status as a sort of “god class.” Additionally, LevelLoader can now just
call these methods to initialize the controllers, removing that clutter from its
implementation and making it much more readable. Within InitializeControllers
itself, the InitializeKeyboard method has one single purpose and accomplishes it
in a simple way, registering each command and key and adding their functionality
to the controller and playable sprite. There are no vague identifiers, the
methods aren’t too long, and parameter lists are short. The class is clear,
concise, and cohesive, and is fantastic for improving readability among multiple
classes. Great job!
