Code Quality Review

Sprint #2
File being reviewed: DrawSprite.cs / DrawStaticSprite.cs
Author of file being reviewed: Matt Russotti and Nick Trambitas

The code quality in these files is high and well thought out. There was one
place for improvement in code reusability. One of the modifications made was to
change the draw method to have a color parameter, but so far most of the calls
to this method in our code base use the default color. A suggestion could be to
keep the original draw method and overload it instead to address the cases that
aren't the default color.

When considering coupling, it is very loose in both of these files. This is a
class that just takes in a sprite and draws it to the screen, so it is a good
job keeping the task specific. This leads into cohesion. Since the classes are
only meant to draw, there is very high cohesion. All variables and methods show
a clear role in how they help to draw the sprite.
