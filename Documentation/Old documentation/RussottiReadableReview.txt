Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
- All methods are short and data driven
- Variables are labeled meaningfully
- Methods are labeled accuratly
- No comments but none are really needed
- Code has been cleaned up, methods are much cleaner
- I wouldn't say anything is unreadable. This is very well done
