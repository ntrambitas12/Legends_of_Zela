Sprint 5 reflection. 
For sprint 5 we decided to implement level saving and fix some things on our backlog. This sprint was much smaller than the others 
so some people had trouble finding ways to contribute initially. After meeting up we divided up work for everyone to do. We are so proud
with the way this game has turned out. If you showed us this at the beginning of the semester we would be impressed with what we were able to do.
We did a great job refining our processes to make our team as efficient as possible by playing to everyone's strengths. We definitely have room to improve 
but we have come a long way in the short time we have been working together.

Known Issues:
1. We chose to implement Link's health in terms of full heath rather than half hearts. His health value is still true to the game, however.
2. Link does not have frames for holding up the Bow and Triforce. This needs to be changed in SpriteFactory.
3. Locked doors are shown as closed doors, but retain their intended functionality.
4. Randomly, when enemies die, some invisible entity is left behind that damages the player.
5. You can lock up the movement by holding down multiple keys

Known fixes from Sprint 4:
1. Aquamentus shoots fireballs correctly.
2. Movement is a bit smoother
3. Sprite factory got refactored
4. Enemies have correct health
