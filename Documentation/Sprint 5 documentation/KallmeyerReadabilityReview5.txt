This PR is once again a large bonus to readability for the LevelLoader file.
The ParseRoom method was cleaned up tremendously by factoring out position and
projectile variables. Additionally, the large body of ParseRoom was cut
completely down by factoring out each functional step in parsing the room into
their own methods. These methods have precise, readable names which tell you
exactly what they do, making reading through ParseRoom much easier as you can
see each step laid out in a method name. Overall, this is easily the most
readable our LevelLoader file has ever been. Great job!
