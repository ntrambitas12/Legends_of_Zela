Known bugs:
1. We chose to implement Link's health in terms of full heath rather than half hearts. His health value is still true to the game, however.
2. Link does not have frames for holding up the Bow and Triforce. This needs to be changed in SpriteFactory.
3. Locked doors are shown as closed doors, but retain their intended functionality.
4. Randomly, when enemies die, some invisible entity is left behind that damages the player.
5. You can lock up the movement by holding down multiple keys
