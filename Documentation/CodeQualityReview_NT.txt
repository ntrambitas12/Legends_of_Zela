One improvement that I've noticed over the course of the sprint was the consolidation of all the item classes
for each different item down into reusuable class. I am very happy to see that. The methods are short and sweet
and simple to read and understand. Overall, the class seems to be following high quality code standards and
has very high cohesion in its methods and almost no coupling. Good work! :)


I can't think of any changes that I would do off the top of my head. I wouldn't be able to code it better than 
how it's written. Looks like it's maintainable. 
If anything comes up in future sprints, we can address it but good work!
