Sprint #2

One improvement that I've noticed over the course of the sprint was the consolidation of all the item classes
for each different item down into reusuable class. I am very happy to see that. The methods are short and sweet
and simple to read and understand. Overall, the class seems to be following high quality code standards and
has very high cohesion in its methods and almost no coupling. Good work! :)


I can't think of any changes that I would do off the top of my head. I wouldn't be able to code it better than 
how it's written. Looks like it's maintainable. 
If anything comes up in future sprints, we can address it but good work!

Sprint #2
File being reviewed: SpriteFactory.cs

SpriteFactory has come a long way since last sprint. I really like how
the sprite frames and textures are organized at the top of the file by
sections of types of sprites (blocks, enemies, link, projecitles, and items).
This makes it super easy to maintain and keep track of.

All the methods in SpriteFactory are very short and easy to understand. 
SpriteFactory is maintainable since it's easy to add a new sprite and instantiate
one if we ever decide to add more enemies to the game. 
Overall, great work on spriteFactory!
