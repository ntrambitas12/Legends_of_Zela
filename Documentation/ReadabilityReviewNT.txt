Code review took 15 minutes

Code is easily readable. All variables are declared at the top of the class and
initialized right below in the first method. Variables have clear names and
meanings which can easily be deciphered. Each method is cohesive and concise
with very specific intentions/behavior, so this file has high cohesion. You can
set and return each variable for the items, and it is clear which methods
accomplish which task. The only thing I noticed that might be a potential for issues
is that the keyboard controller has a draw method that doesn't do anything. It's 
there but not implemented. Looks like it's there to make the interface complete.
Might not be the best idea/design choice but it will work for now. Overall,
good work!
