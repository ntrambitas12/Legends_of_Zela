Overall, DrawSprite is very easily readable. The variables are declared right under the class declaration, and
all fields are practical in terms of their naming. The spacing throughout the document, however, is a bit odd,
and leaves a little bit to be desired. Comments are provided where clarity is needed, but the difference between
the two draw methods should be more explicitly stated. Coupling is tight. Great job!

Sprint #3
File being reviewed: LevelLoader.cs

Code review took 15 minutes

In LevelLoader, the first couple of methods are quite easy to read, exceeding no more than ~10 lines (with the exception of the dictionary
loader, which is necessary). In the ParseRoom method, however, the code seems to drag on a bit, being around 4 levels deep when you take all the
if statements and loops into account. A lot of this code could be pulled out and refactored to another method, and then be called on each
var parseType in parseTypes. Speaking of parseTypes, this goes a long way in making the code readable, as it is easier to understand
how our code reads in object groups from XML files.
