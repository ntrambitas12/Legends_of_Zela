Overall, DrawSprite is very easily readable. The variables are declared right under the class declaration, and
all fields are practical in terms of their naming. The spacing throughout the document, however, is a bit odd,
and leaves a little bit to be desired. Comments are provided where clarity is needed, but the difference between
the two draw methods should be more explicitly stated. Coupling is tight. Great job!
